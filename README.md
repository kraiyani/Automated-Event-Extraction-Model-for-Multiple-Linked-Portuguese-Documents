# Automated-Event-Extraction-Model-for-Multiple-Linked-Portuguese-Documents
In recent time, machine learning is booming and researchers are trying to use its application where ever possible. Such street of the domain is legal documents. Here, this paper talks about event extraction from police legal documents. These extracted events are manually verified with linguist and it is able to obtain 95.93\% accuracy. Further, with help of ontological structure, these events are mapped as a knowledge graph. The ontology represents the name entity and events associated with each document. Through SPARQL query, this knowledge base is accessible and with such representation, this helps in accessing the legal document in form of question-answer, making easier in accessing the information.
The evaluation dataset was created by the consortium of the project Agatha with documents from several online sources, aiming to illustrate and evaluate the performance of the developed systems. It is composed of 51 documents with 1221 sentences and 48914 words.
